// Utilities
// - variables

@import "utilities/__utilities.scss";

// Base
@import "base/__base.scss";
// The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate stuff for your project.
// In there, you might find the reset (or Normalize.css, or whatever), probably some
// stuff dealing with typography, and, depending on the project, maybe some other files.

// Modules
// - forms
// - modals
// - any styles for reusable site modules (should be added in separate files)
@import "modules/__modules.scss";

// Partials
// - This is analogous to the Pug partials
// - These are large sections of a page that are used globally
// - header--global
// - footer--global
@import "partials/__partials.scss";

// Pages
// - every page on the website
// - each page's scss should be wrapped in the page class that shows on the html element
@import "pages/__pages.scss";

// Views
// - mainly modals
@import "views/__views.scss";

// Vendors
@import "vendor/__vendor.scss";
// And last but not least, you will probably have a vendors/ folder containing all the CSS files from external
// libraries and frameworks – Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those
// aside in the same folder is a good way to tell “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.
